# SpaceMaze
Video Game made with Unity and C#

The goal is to escape from a ship you've been locked in by solving enigmas in the rooms hidden by the labyrinth. 
The second player will have a PDF containing the maze's map and clues to help the player solve the four enigmas.
You have to complete all the enigmas in the rooms to unlock the final room's door and escape the ship.
